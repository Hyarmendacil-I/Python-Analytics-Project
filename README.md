# Python-Analytics-Project
Masters fin project tackling data processing, programming, and analysis of 279 variables as risk factors for heart disease. Data provided by the CDC in the BRFSS 2020 report published on Kaggle.com.

The dataset is not in my repository, because it is over 330MBs, so it cannot be uploaded to GitHub even with the command line. The original data set can be found from the Kaggle source it was pulled from, listed here:

Thanks for your consideration in viewing my project, I really appreciate you giving me a look.

Best, Alex. :)
